The idea behind this repository is to build a small package that contains building blocks of many modern Multi-Task Learning algorithms and then use it to reproduce papers. This is still work in progress.

Papers Reproduced:
Modeling Task Relationships in Multi-task Learning with Multi-gate Mixture-of-Experts by Jiaqi Ma et al (KDD 2018)
